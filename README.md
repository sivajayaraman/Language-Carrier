# Language-Carrier

Fourth Push : 
  Tasks Done so far:
      <br>1. Video/Audio to .wav form converted using ffmpeg in source_base_conversion.py file.
        <br>1.1 Basic Exceptions such as File not found handled.
        <br>1.2 Other audio conversion exceptions handled.
      <br>2.  From this file, audio.wav is created from the source and the file, source_translation.py is called.
      <br>3.  silenceBasedConversion method is invoked. The audio source path is hardcoded.
      <br>4.  Necessary text files are created to store results.
      <br>5.  The audio.wav file is broken into smaller chunks, so that, it will be easy for the audio to be converted.
      <br>6.  This also reduces the audio size and length.
      <br>7.  Chunks are then converted into slow playback to make efficient audio to text conversion.
      <br>8.  Each Audio file is converted to text. Exception is handled.
      <br>9.  Text converted to other languages.
      <br>10. Audio developed from text in translated_audio directory.
      <br>11. UI Development using Tkinter.
      <br>12. Unsupported files handling.
      <br>13. Program Files reduced to two,merging the required.
      <br>14. File Input Handling
      <br>15. Hardcoded paths automated.
      <br>16. Progressbar added
      <br>17. All case Exceptions handled 
<br>Tasks to be done:
      <br>1. Integration.
      <br>2. Retry files handling.
      <br>3. Male/Female versions for the audio files should be added.
      <br>4. UI enhancements
      <br>5. NLP Module building
      <br>6. Add explaining comments in Program file
      <br>7. Unrecognized files handling
      <br>8. Code Standardization
      <br>9. Progress bar and loop handling
